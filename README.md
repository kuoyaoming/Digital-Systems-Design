# Digital Systems Design

106.2 數位系統設計課程作業（Verilog/Quartus/ModelSim）

### Overview

This repository contains homework/lab projects for a Digital Systems Design course. Each assignment is a Verilog-based project with its own testbench, simulation setup (ModelSim), and Quartus project files for synthesis and FPGA programming.

### Repository structure

- `hhw1/` — Homework 1 project (Quartus project, Verilog sources, testbench, simulation setup)
- `hhw2/` — Homework 2 project
- `hw3/` — Homework 3 project
- `hw4/` — Homework 4 project
- `README.md` — This document

Typical contents inside each `hw*` directory:

- Verilog sources: e.g., `counter.v`, `hw2.v`, `hw3.v`, `hw4.v`, helper modules
- Testbenches: e.g., `hw1_tb.v`, `hw2_tb.v`, `hw3_tb.v`, `hw4_tb.v`
- Quartus project files: `*.qpf`, `*.qsf`
- ModelSim setup: `simulation/modelsim/` with `*.do` scripts
- Build artifacts: `output_files/`, `incremental_db/` (can be regenerated)

### Requirements

- Intel Quartus Prime (Lite/Standard) with supported device family
- ModelSim (Intel FPGA Edition) or QuestaSim for simulation
- A supported FPGA board if you plan to program hardware (optional)

### Quick start — simulate

You can run simulations using ModelSim/Questa. From the GUI:

1. Open ModelSim.
2. Change directory to the target project folder, e.g. `hhw1/simulation/modelsim`.
3. Run the provided script, for example: `do hhw1_run_msim_rtl_verilog.do`.

From a shell, a typical pattern is:

```bash
cd hhw1/simulation/modelsim
vsim -do hhw1_run_msim_rtl_verilog.do
```

Adjust the folder/script names for `hhw2`, `hw3`, or `hw4` as needed.

### Build and program — Quartus

1. Open Quartus and open the corresponding `*.qpf` (e.g., `hhw1.qpf`).
2. Set the correct device if prompted.
3. Compile the project (Analysis & Synthesis → Fitter → Assembler).
4. Use the Programmer to load the generated `.sof` from `output_files/` to your FPGA board.

### Notes

- The `output_files/` and `incremental_db/` directories are generated by tools and can be removed and regenerated by Quartus.
- Testbenches are provided for each assignment to verify functionality before synthesis.
- Some folders include vendor/IP models or datasheets used by the labs.

### Language

The code and file names are primarily in English, while some documents and comments may be in Chinese to match the course materials.
